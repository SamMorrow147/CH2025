Team Member Images

For each team member, you'll need two types of images:

1. Background Photo (Main image):
   - Dimensions: Around 280px width Ã— 380px height
   - This is the main photo for each card

2. Silhouette/Character Image:
   - A transparent PNG of the person (like a cutout or silhouette)
   - This image appears when hovering over the card
   - Should be a clean silhouette/cutout with transparent background

Name your files consistently:
- placeholderX.jpg - for background photos
- silhouetteX.png - for silhouette images

Replace the sample data in src/home/TeamSection.jsx with actual team member information.
